# Windots

## My personal Windows wrapper for my [dotfiles](https://github.com/einKnuffy/dotfiles)

> Currently it only modifies powershell to look, feel and behave *better*

> Additionally, you then for the WSL have to manually clone [dotfiles](https://github.com/einKnuffy/dotfiles)

### Just run `RUN_ME.bat` and after the file deleted itself you can delete the cloned folder as it duppicated the necessary files into `%localappdata%\windots\`

Thanks!
